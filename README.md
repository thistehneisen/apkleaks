## Installation

It's fairly simple to install **APKLeaks**:

### from PyPi

```bash
$ pip3 install apkleaks
```

### from Source

Clone repository and install requirements:

```bash
$ git clone https://github.com/dwisiswant0/apkleaks
$ cd apkleaks/
$ pip3 install -r requirements.txt
```

### from Docker

Pull the Docker image by running:

```bash
$ docker pull dwisiswant0/apkleaks:latest
```

### Dependencies

APKLeaks using [jadx](https://github.com/skylot/jadx) disassembler to decompile APK file. If it doesn't exist in your environment, it'll ask you to download or nah.

## Usage

Simply,

```bash
$ apkleaks -f ~/path/to/file.apk
# from Source
$ python3 apkleaks.py -f ~/path/to/file.apk
# or with Docker
$ docker run -it --rm -v /tmp:/tmp dwisiswant0/apkleaks -f /tmp/diva.apk
```

### Options

```console
$ apkleaks -h
usage: apkleaks [-h] -f FILE [-o OUTPUT] [-p PATTERN] [--json]

optional arguments:
  -h, --help            show this help message and exit
  -f FILE, --file FILE  APK file to scanning
  -o OUTPUT, --output OUTPUT
                        Write to file results (random if not set)
  -p PATTERN, --pattern PATTERN
                        Path to custom patterns JSON
  --json                Save as JSON format
```

In general, if you don't provide `-o` argument, then it will generate results file automatically.

Custom patterns can be added with the following flag `--pattern /path/to/rules.json` to provide sensitive _search rules_ in the JSON file format. If not set, it'll use default patterns from [regexes.json](https://github.com/dwisiswant0/apkleaks/blob/master/config/regexes.json) file.

Example patterns file:

```json
// rules.json
{
  "Amazon AWS Access Key ID": "AKIA[0-9A-Z]{16}",
  ...
}
```

```
$ apkleaks -f /path/to/file.apk -p rules.json -o ~/Documents/apkleaks-results.txt
```
